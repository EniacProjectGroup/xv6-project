# General Information and Installation of xv6 Kernel

### About xv6 kernel
The xv6 kernel is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system developed by MIT for educational purposes. Written in C, it mimics Unix Version 6 (hence the name xv6), which was an influential version of Unix from the 1970s. xv6 is used to teach fundamental OS concepts, such as process management, memory management, file systems, and inter-process communication, in a simplified and readable way.
